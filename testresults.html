    <h4>Myers & Briggs</h4>
    <p> <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/a1ffeb6df931a">16 Personalities Profile</a> <br>I am a Turbulent Logician (INTP-T). Logicians are the smallest group only making up 3% of the
        population. That is something I didn't expect. A lot of the things described in this profile align with opinions some of my friends have of me. This test has made me aware I need to collaborate
        better, instead of using people as a sounding board and doing what I want anyway. When forming groups I should make sure I look for someone with the ability to challenge my ideas. This will help keep me 
        moving in the right direction. I should also make myself aware of who in the group may be swayed by their emotions to avoid any unnecessary conflicts.

    <h4>Learning Style</h4>
        <img src="learningstyle.png"width="900" height="800" alt="Learning Style" class=middle>
    <p>The tactile learning bit makes sense. I've never really enjoyed reading a manual and prefer when someone shows me how things are done.
       In a team environment, I have to remember people don't learn the same way. I need to be patient with people in the group who don't learn
       from seeing it done the first time. When forming teams I should definitely seek out Auditory and Visual learners as they will create a higher
       quality end product. They will be able to tell me how they see it so I'm able to reach the most people effectively.</p>

       <h4>Creativity Test</h4>


       <img src="test 3.png"width="1500" height="800" alt="Learning Style" class=middle>


<p>This one surprised me a little bit. I figured I'd immediately be in the top ranking. In actual fact, I'm on the cusp of entering the top. 
    The thing that stands out is it asks me to bounce my ideas off of others to create better ideas. This links nicely with the Myers-Brigs. 
    As a thinker who throws ideas out thick and fast, I don't actually correctly utilise those around me to make bigger better ideas. So when 
    forming teams I should find someone who more creative than myself to focus some of my creativity into more of a discussion. The results of
     this I'd hope would be a better thought out idea and subsequently a better result for the entire group.
