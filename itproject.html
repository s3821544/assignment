<h4>Project Concept</h4>
        <p>My project idea is a smartphone app for people to use to challenge their views and beliefs. The app would account for your views and then provide articles 
           that make you understand your own argument and alternate points of view. It will be small pieces of information that would offer you the opportunity to be linked to 
           the original source or an article written about the source. The purpose of this app would be to expand someoneâ€™s understanding on a few or a lot of topics.</p>

<h4> Motivation</h4>

<p>My motivation for this is quite often people don't know why they hold certain points of view and don't have the proper information to understand their point of view. 
    This app could cover a wide variety of topics. It could encompass everything from political views through to opinions on more difficult topics like pro-choice. My main 
    goal for this app is to increase knowledge around whichever topic that person is interested in by providing vetted sources.
    </p>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The app itself would have an initial sign up which would include creating a login and taking an initial test around some of your views. From there it would generate a few generic quizzes 
    around the provided responses and then tailor the rest of the experience from there.<br><br>
    Initial login would be a simple user name and password. This would have to be fairly secure. When dealing with someone's views if someone else was easily able to gain access to this it 
    could create a negative experience when their views were exposed. <br><br>     
        The initial quiz would ask a set list of questions around the more common differing view points. This would include ideas that are left or right politically i.e.; for or against 
        welfare, for or against social healthcare; immigration and foreign aid. This would be used as an initial phase for the app to work out any bugs or experience issues before adding 
        in the more controversial topics. <br><br>       
        After filling in the initial questions it would generate some generic quizzes to ascertain whether you hold those views because you understand them or because it's just what you 
        believe. From here we get into the tailoring side of things. I would use a logic tree to move them through the various articles. The user would help determine their own path. This 
        would allow the app to slowly progress them through the relevant materials in a way that wasn't controversial or unexpected.    <br><br>    
        Once the user base is high enough, the user experiences are surveyed and the app is calibrated, the expansion of the app would be a live debate between differing opinions.
        This would be achieved through a live stream that could be done via a live studio or from multiple locations using video conferencing software. During these events, live polls would occur.
        There would be a Q&A at the end to allow people to ask specific questions. There would also be a poll around who won the debate and an opportunity for topics to be revisited in
        a forum or video update.<br><br>
        The biggest part of this will be the research and database side of things. Researchers would be needed to verify the articles and sources. Just as important would be someone making sure 
        all of your links are correct. The last thing is utilising all of this information correctly. It would be important to constantly poll users on how much value they are getting 
        out of your service. A service like this would require constant monitoring 
        from everyone involved.  Your researchers would have to be aware of new material out and your technical experts would have to make sure the app was generating the right results.
        </p>
<h4>Tools and Technology</h4>
<p>This application is a culmination of a few other styles of apps. There are plenty of quiz apps and plenty of applications that filter information to get you the things you've asked 
    for i.e. a sports app where you choose your favourite teams. The difference here is this would need to be more nuanced than the others on offer. The basic things needed would be a 
    server for storing all of your information, a database on the server for storing customer logins and your articles.</p>

<h4>Skills</h4>
<p>The skills needed for this would be not only IT related but also expand into other fields. Writing software that challenges a users point of view will require a learning specialist and 
    probably a psychologist to make sure your app progresses the user at the appropriate pace. No special hardware is required, however, the building of the app will be quite complex.
     Collating data and then tailoring it in a way that your end user is constantly challenged but not turned off would be no small feat.</p>
<h4>Outcomes</h4>
<p>If my project is successful, there will be a better discussion around difficult topics. The reason for a mobile app instead of a website is it's always with you.
    Every time you have 5 minutes spare you can jump in and read something or learn something new. Trying to get someone to spend hours on end improving their understanding isn't
     easy but a few minutes at a time would be easier. Especially around election time, you would have more people having more informed discussions. 
    This leads to the better discourse around politics which leads to a better democracy. The point of my app isn't to make people see things my way, 
    it's to push the Socratic Method. Having all of the information leads you to better decisions.</p>
