    This is a job for someone with a wealth of experience, a lot of knowledge and the desire to make things simpler for the end user. It's a highly technical role,
     but it also gives you the opportunity to help other people around you get better at what they do.I'm currently one of the more knowledgeable managers in my current job and I often get 
     phone calls regarding common and uncommon issues. It gives me a sense of pride that people are willing to contact me for help due to my wealth of knowledge. Moving into a new 
     industry I'd like to work towards being that guy again. It would also force me to keep learning and constantly challenge my skills.This job would require a high level of expertise around 
     the various forms of software the company is using. You would need to be able to manage many projects and people at once. Although only working with a small team there would be people to 
     report to regularly and provide progress updates on the various projects occurring all at the same time. Then there is the roll-out of your changes, overseeing that these go smoothly. 
     This is a very diverse role, that would have its challenges but definitely a lot of rewards.

<h4>Current Skill</h4>
<p>My current level of skill is building computers and basic troubleshooting.The only programming I've done was Delphi in high school and I can't remember 
    the first thing about Pascal. So I'm at the very start of a long road to acquire the necessary knowledge. However, I have excellent interpersonal skills
     due to the many years of customer service. Although not directly transferable there are some definite advantages to having to interact with people from all walks of life.</p>

<h4>How to Acquire the Necessary Skills</h4>
<p>My plan for achieving this level of capability will require a great deal of dedication and hard work. I will have to take full advantage of 
    the opportunities that come my way. This includes making the most of my time studying and subsequently when I am working in the industry, 
    I will have to continue to push myself to stand out amongst my peers. I will have to constantly up skill and learn all of the emerging technologies. 
    These roles all seem to require you to have a knowledge of Java, HTML and Cloud Servers. It will take many years to get to a point where I'm even realistically a 
    good fit for this role however I'm looking forward to the challenge. This as is suggested, may also change drastically.</p>
