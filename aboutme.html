<p>My name is Sean I'm a 31 year old Bottle Shop Manager living in Brisbane. I am a mad sports fan and love a good video game. 
    At one point I owned more sports jerseys than I did any other form of a shirt. 
    My teams are the New York Knicks for basketball and Arsenal for football. For video games, I'm all about the shooters and Rocket League. 
    I am a big fan of the Borderlands series, old school battlefield, Counter Strike Go and have been playing more Apex Legends than I care to admit.</p>
<h4> My Interest in It</h4>
<p>My interest in IT is centred around learning about how the technology around me is constructed. I use technology to do so much in my life, 
    but I don't understand how it all works. I built my first computer in my early 20's and since then have built two more. 
    Building and troubleshooting the initial boot I'm fairly confident with but I'm keen to learn more of the how my PC actually creates the experiences I have. 
    I would be lying if I didn't say the money on offer in this industry was also a huge factor.</p>
<h4>Why Rmit</h4>
<p>
    I decided to come to RMIT because it allows me to continue working full time. I have been pushed for a long time by friends and family to go to university and make something of 
    myself as I have always been told that I'm smart enough. I ignored the call for a very long time (my entire 20's).
     After cracking the big 30 it was time to make some choices for my future. I was looking for a totally online degree and applied through Open Universities Australia. 
     They directed me to this course as a way to start my path towards a career in IT.
    </p>
<h4>What Do I Expect To Learn?</h4>

<p>During my time at RMIT, I'm expecting to learn all of the skills I need to be successful in the industry.
   With such a broad range of roles within the industry, 
   I'm keen to find out more about all of the roles within the industry. 
   I definitely intend on having a broad skill base, because like everything else I get involved with I don't like to not know things.</p>
